    <h1>
        The 8086 CPU is divided into two units, the bus interface unit and the Execution unit
    </h1>
    <ul>
        <h2>BIU: BUS interface unit</h2>
        <li>this unit is responsable of most of the work executed by the CPU Like:</li>
        <li>fetching instrucitons</li>
        <li>reading and writing memory variables</li>
        <li>input/output data from and to connected devices</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <h2>EU: Execution unit</h2>
        <li>this unit job is to decode and execute instructions and its made up of:</li>
        <li>Arthmeatics and logical unit</li>
        <a>Flag or status Registers</a>
        <br /><a>General purpose registers</a>
        <br /><a>Temporary Registers</a>
        <br /><span>EU Control System</span>
    </ul>

    <span>
        The execution unit:
        fetches the instructions from the instruciton queue (inside BIU), Decodes it<br />
        and then executes the instruction contents.<br />
        if the Executions unit ever needs information stored in the memory, it will order <br />
        the BIU unit to retreive it by sending the address of that information in the memory.<br />

        The most important job for the EU is the Arthmeatics and logical operations.<br />
        after each instruction execution the EU checks the flag registers.<br />
